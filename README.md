## Example

### 1. Install .NET Core SDK 3.1.301 or later

You can find the SDK at [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### 2. Install the template

```
> dotnet new --install Cake.Frosting.Template
```

### 3. Create a new Frosting project

Now it's time to create a new Frosting project.
Go to the repository where you want to add a new Frosting build script and run the following command:

```
> dotnet new cakefrosting
```

### 4. Profit

Now you should be able to run your newly created builds script.

```powershell
> ./build.ps1
```

**NOTE:** You're not supposed to commit the produced binaries to your repository.
The above command is what you're expected to run from your bootstrapper.
